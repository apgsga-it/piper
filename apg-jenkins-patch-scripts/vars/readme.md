# Folder for Gobal Shared Libraries for Jenkins Pipelines

This the folder for shared functions of Gobal Shared Libraries for Pipeline Groovy scripts, see https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/
By convention Jenkins looks for src , var & resources folder for Pipeline Code. Since we are *only* using scripts currently the var folder is the only folder needed.
